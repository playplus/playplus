<h1>it begins here...</h1>
<p>
    <b>Play Plus Project</b> was founded on the idea to let users display and benefit from additional (personalized) content in facebook. The facebook network has become a extremely important part in the life of young and old internet users, especially for distributing information. Without judging this development, many organizations (such as universities, companies) would increase effectiveness and value of their services, if they could exploit facebook's popularity. It is surely not hard to find a lot of applications of this basic idea, so please see the "concept" section for further thoughts on this topic.

<h1>life is about playing</h1>
<p>
  The purpose of Play Plus is to give developers unified platform on which they can, starting from the above ideas, 'make life easier' for some users. It is not only aimed at the professionals (and 'commercialized') but also at the organizations who want to <b>play with the web's opportunities</b> and build something helpful and constructive on their own. This project is far from calling itself good or standard for this purpose. But if you think that there is potential behind the concept of Play Plus please see the Developer Section and contribute to this project with your knowledge. The world needs you ;)
 <br> Finally also consider ...
</p>
<h1>the distribution of power</h1>
<p>
    facebook's position in the web gives it a lot of powers; among them the power to control the "way social networks work" and thereby how we communicate and how we get our information in our everyday 'web lifes'. Attempts to challenge facebook over this position like Google's Google+ have shown that (although the web is never in a 'final state') it is very hard to catch up with facebook. From this point of view, Play Plus will give developers the possibilities to challenge <b>facebook's 'sovereignty of design'</b>. This (or similar approaches) might have the power to make facebook become a more open and transparent platform. And it might be the only the way for facebook to become a universally useful network in the long run (which i guess is something they want to be?). But right now facebook is giant, who does not like code to come visit him at his house but rather tries to spread his own code all over the web. In this way however, it want be able to satisfy all the specific needs of its users.
