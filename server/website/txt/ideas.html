<h1>this it what's possible</h1>
<p>
    we have realized the idea behind Play Plus in an extremely light weight <b>browser plugin</b>. There might be a lot of applications for this, as for example:
    <ul>
    <li>some stuff about universities</li>
    <li>something about organizational structures</li>
    <li>words regarding stuff like RADIOS</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h1>future implementations</h1>
<p>
    If the concept of Play Plus proves itself as useful as we claim it be on our "Home" page, one could think about more general implementations of it. Maybe natively integrated in facebook or a browser, but this is not likely to happen now; and the most interesting thing about the future is that we don't know it.
